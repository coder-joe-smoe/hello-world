github hello world guide

Hello my username is coder-joe-smoe and I like to do web development. I'm familiar with HTML and CSS primarily. I'd love to learn javascript and some libraries such as angular. 

I've learned to do some javascript, discovered that python is a really useful language and even created a program using scripting language ahk. I'd like to still continue my learning and learn advanced javascript and applications. I'd like to create more useful programs that will help my team scale quicker than ever before!!

I want to see if this rewrites, add after I pull the other lines...
...it creates a conflict that must be resolved by the contributor
